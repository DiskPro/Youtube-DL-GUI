# Youtube-DL-GUI
A Youtube-DL GUI made in C#

## Small notice

Due to the current of the [youtube-dl repository](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24872911), following an unjustified takedown by the RIAA, some features might not work well. Youtube-DL is a tool that requires constant updating and improvements to deal with changes to Youtube and other websites, and this action might impair further development for a while.

If you want to know more about how the RIAA infringes upon your rights, read about it [here](https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2003/06/25) and [here](https://gizmodo.com/eff-responds-to-riaas-new-isp-bully-tactics-237338).

## Current supported features
* Download queue importing/exporting
* Thumbnails
* Queue editing
* FFMpeg GUI built-in
* UI customization
and much more!
